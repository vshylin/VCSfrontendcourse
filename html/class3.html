                <h3 class="red-royal"> Story of a knight</h3>
                <article>
                    Sir Alaric, the bravest knight of the realm, 
                    stood alone on the cliff's edge, 
                    his armor glinting in the fading sunlight. 
                    Below, a dragon's roar echoed through the valley, 
                    but with a resolute heart, he tightened his grip on his sword, 
                    ready to defend his kingdom one last time. 
                    As the beast emerged from the shadows, the knight charged forward, 
                    a symbol of courage against the encroaching darkness.

                <article>
                    In the dim light of dawn, 
                    Edda toiled in the barren fields, 
                    her hands calloused and weary. 
                    Despite the harshness of her life, 
                    a spark of hope lingered in her eyes, 
                    dreaming of a better tomorrow.

                <h3 class="red-royal"> Monster hidden in a cave  </h3>
                <article>
                    Deep within the shadowy cave, an ancient monster lay dormant,
                     its scales glistening faintly in the darkness. 
                     Every tremor in the earth whispered of its eventual awakening,
                     a harbinger of terror lurking just beneath the surface.
